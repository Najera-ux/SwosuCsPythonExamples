Dear Journal,

Today I heroically wrestled a Wi-Fi signal into submission using only my sheer willpower and a mug of lukewarm coffee.  
At one point, my laptop hissed like an angry cat, but in the end, I prevailed.  
Victory smells faintly of burnt circuits and triumph.

P.S. I think my USB drive just blinked at me. Twice.

I would like to point out that files are persistent and what that means is that after you save the document the document lives on the computer and that means when we turn it off and we turn it back on again it's still going to be there the other nice thing about that is when we push the file up to the Internet it's still going to exist and we can manage all of this with source code and make the changes there

Sincerely,
The Technomancer Formerly Known as Sleep-Deprived
