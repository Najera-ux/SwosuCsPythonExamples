Dear Journal,

Today I heroically wrestled a Wi-Fi signal into submission using only my sheer willpower and a mug of lukewarm coffee.  
At one point, my laptop hissed like an angry cat, but in the end, I prevailed.  
Victory smells faintly of burnt circuits and triumph.

P.S. I think my USB drive just blinked at me. Twice.

Sincerely,
The Technomancer Formerly Known as Sleep-Deprived
