Welcome to the Great File of Mysteries!
Each line reveals a clue, a laugh, or a lesson in coding wisdom.

First truth: The bug you fear most is probably just a missing colon.
Second truth: Sleep is a poor substitute for a good syntax highlighter.
Third truth: "print()" is the universal cry for help and celebration.

    and the worst ones *feel* like interpretive dance.

Now go forth, oh reader of lines â€” and conquer your next compile!
