\section*{5.1.6 The Good and the Bad of Mathematical Induction (Teacher Notes)}

\textbf{Goal:} Help students appreciate the difference between discovery and verification.  

\textbf{Discussion ideas:}
- “Induction is like checking the dominoes, not designing the pattern.”
- Let students brainstorm other “confirming” tools in life (spell checkers, test cases, scientific replication).
- Emphasize that while induction proves correctness, it doesn’t always reveal meaning.

\textbf{Extension:}  
Show an example where induction works but intuition gives a deeper reason (e.g., arithmetic sum formula visualized as a triangle of dots).
