\section*{5.1.6 The Good and the Bad of Mathematical Induction}

Mathematical induction is like a loyal friend—dependable, logical, and occasionally a little dull at parties.  

The good news: It’s powerful for proving that a statement is true for all integers after you’ve already suspected it’s true.  
The bad news: It’s not a creative friend—it can’t invent new truths, only confirm them.

\textbf{Reflect:}  
Why might a mathematician prefer a proof that shows *why* something works instead of just confirming that it does?  
Can you think of a time you accepted something as true but wanted to understand it more deeply?

\textbf{Challenge:}  
Find a theorem or formula that can be proved in more than one way (like by induction and by algebraic reasoning). Which proof do you find more enlightening, and why?
