\section*{5.1.5 Guidelines for Proofs by Mathematical Induction (Teacher Notes)}

\textbf{Instructor Notes:}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Emphasize that induction proofs are about *structure*, not memorization.
  \item Encourage students to verbalize the “base case” and “inductive step” as storytelling.
  \item Common mistake: forgetting to restate the inductive hypothesis clearly.
  \item Visuals: draw the domino chain, ladder, or stair-step on the board.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Classroom Challenge:}  
Provide a false inductive proof (e.g., “All horses are the same color”) and ask
students to spot the flaw. Use this to introduce why precision in defining the
base case matters.
