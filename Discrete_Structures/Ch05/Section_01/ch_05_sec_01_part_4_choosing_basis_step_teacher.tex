\section*{5.1.4 Choosing the Correct Basis Step (Teacher Notes)}

\textbf{Discussion prompt:}
Ask students why $P(0)$ might make sense as a basis step in problems involving
“nonnegative integers.” Explore how induction “shifts” the starting point.

\textbf{Solution example:}
For the sum formula,
\[
1 + 2 + \cdots + n = \frac{n(n+1)}{2},
\]
verify $P(0)$:
\[
0 = \frac{0(0+1)}{2} = 0,
\]
which is true. Then show:
\[
P(k) \Rightarrow P(k+1)
\]
and complete the proof algebraically.

\textbf{Extension:}
Challenge students to apply induction beginning at $b=-3$ for a pattern that
holds for all integers greater than or equal to $-3$.
