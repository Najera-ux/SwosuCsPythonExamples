Profile code so we see how much memory it uses
Time how long a code takes to complete a tast multiple times
Keep track of how long a code takes to complete a task multiple times
Reort back the best time for that data set size, the worst time for that data set, and the average time for that data set.
Keep track of memory used for that data set size.
The code should be able to use multiple algorithms to complete the same process
